# Jobs Component

This README provides an overview of the Jobs component, which is part of a React application for displaying job listings.

## Overview

The Jobs component fetches job data from an API and displays it in a user-friendly format. It includes features such as pagination, bookmarking, and error handling.

## Features

- Fetches job listings from an API
- Displays job details including title, company, location, salary, job type, experience, and qualifications
- Supports pagination with a "Load More" button
- Allows bookmarking of jobs
- Handles loading states and errors
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Installation

1. Ensure you have React and its dependencies installed in your project.
2. Install additional required packages:

```bash
npm install axios react-router-dom
```

3. Copy the `Jobs.js` file into your project's components directory.
4. Create a `Jobs.css` file in the same directory for styling.

## Usage

To use the Jobs component in your React application:

1. Import the component:

```javascript
import Jobs from './path/to/Jobs';
```

2. Use the component in your JSX, passing the required props:

```jsx
<Jobs addBookmark={yourBookmarkFunction} />
```

Make sure to implement the `addBookmark` function in your parent component or context.

## Props

- `addBookmark` (Function): A function to handle bookmarking jobs. It receives the job object as an argument.

## API Integration

The component expects the API to return data in the following format:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "title": "Job Title",
      "company_name": "Company Name",
      "primary_details": {
        "Place": "Location",
        "Salary": "Salary Range",
        "Job_Type": "Job Type",
        "Experience": "Required Experience",
        "Qualification": "Required Qualification"
      },
      "job_tags": [
        {
          "value": "Tag Text",
          "bg_color": "#ColorCode",
          "text_color": "#ColorCode"
        }
      ]
    }
    // ... more job listings
  ]
}
```

Ensure your API endpoint (`https://testapi.getlokalapp.com/common/jobs`) returns data in this format.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the component by modifying the `Jobs.css` file. The component uses BEM-like class naming for easy styling.

## Error Handling

The component includes basic error handling. If the API request fails, an error message will be displayed to the user.

## Future Improvements

- Implement advanced filtering and sorting options
- Add a search functionality
- Improve accessibility features
- Implement unit and integration tests
